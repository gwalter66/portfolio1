        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My passion for web development comes from videogames.</p>
        <p>Video games allow for the growth of many personl traits such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>communication skills</li>
          <li>self esteem</li>
          <li>critical thinking skills</li> <!possibly reorder to sound better when reading>
          <li>creative thingking</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That someone might not develop without that game.</p>
        <p>A poor website experience may deter a user and prevent them from finding their favorite game</p>
        <p>This makes web development one of the most important parts of reaching people</p>
